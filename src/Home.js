    something bad always happens. New-new-Doctor.
    Allons-y! You can spend the rest of your life with me,
    but I can’t spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on.
    Alone. That’s the curse of the Time Lords.
    You need to get yourself a better dictionary.
    When you do, look up ‘genocide’. You’ll find a little picture of me there,
    and the caption’ll read ‘Over my dead body’. Don’t you think she looks tired?
    Yeah? Well I’m the Lord of Time. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh…</h1>
